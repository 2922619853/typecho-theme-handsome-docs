**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, the main leaker's warehouse address is: https://github.com/KobayashiHome/handsome

In my communication with him, he has already deleted it.

However, I have no way to contact the owner of the following four fork warehouses, so begging github to help me handle it

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The project is not an open source project, a personal charge project, and you can see it from the project's address.


**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

The best way is to prohibit anyone from accessing the infringing warehouse or deleting the infringing warehouse

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**


I contacted the owner of the main warehouse and informed that the other party had deleted the infringing warehouse. However, I cannot contact the owner of other fork warehouses.
